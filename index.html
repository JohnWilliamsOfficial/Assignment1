<i> <b> Interest in IT </b> </i> <br> <br>
Growing up I never really played with toys much, I used to love playing on my Playstation for hours on end or feeling like a hacker jailbreaking my Ipod.  I had a teacher in Primary School who allowed my friends and I to play in the computer lab throughout lunch & recess in which I used to play browser games. Even during our classes when we had to go to the computer rooms, I was always the kid helping the other students plug in their monitor cables and assisting the teacher with any projector or IT issues they may have had. Growing up I never really played with toys much, I used to love playing on my PlayStation for hours on end or feeling like a hacker jailbreaking my iPod.

Even during our classes when we had to go to the computer rooms, I was always the kid helping the other students plug in their monitor cables and assisting the teacher with any projector or IT issues they may have had. <BR> <br>
What really sparked my interest in IT though was when I had gotten my first laptop at age 11 with Windows Vista as the Operating System. Although I didn’t have any internet at home, I’d go to the library to download games to play offline. I started playing less on my PlayStation and started getting more interested in computer parts to build my own PC.  Nonetheless, I saved money and with the help of my parents we bought a pre-built PC which I have upgraded over the years to be more modern which I still use to this day. I’ve been an avid follower of Youtuber Linus Tech Tips for years and he has boosted my spark of interest in IT.<br> <br>
My current IT experience ranges from knowing about the hardware aspect of computers and how they run, having built computers from second hand parts gotten from Facebook marketplace & eBay and selling for a profit.

<p>
<i> <b> Why did I come to RMIT? </b> </i> <br> <br>

I have two main reasons that I chose to come to RMIT, the first being that everything is online and is super flexible for my full-time job which allows me to conduct my study during my own time. The second is that after doing some extensive research in RMIT, I've found that it's a great University to attend due to the reputation and ranking that it had. The current sessions that I've had with tutors and discussions with fellow students, I can very easily see as to why they have this reputation and do not regret joining.
</p>

<p>

<i> <b> What do I expect to learn during my studies? </b> </i> <br> <br>

I expect to learn more about IT and how it’s used during our everyday lives, I’ve already gotten an understanding from the brief sessions that we’ve had. The biggest thing that I want to take away from the course is to think differently and outside the box in terms of generating ideas or solutions for various problems while also having the experience to work from the comfort of anywhere traveling the world.

<p>

<i> <b> What makes the position appealing? Describe it? </b> </i> <br> <br>
 
The position is for an IT application Support Manager responsible for overseeing and managing the systems applications, creating support plans & activities for the particular business. As a manager you will also be responsible for managing a team which includes rostering/staffing, keeping track of KPIs and stats to continuously improve the team. This could also include action plans for the team. <br> <br>

An application manager, being responsible for the softwares that a company uses from the implementation to debugging and coding is highly appealing to me since I've always been an avid tech user. Although this is an IT position, it is also a managerial position which gives me the opportunity to show my extroverted side and work alongside a team. 

</p>


<p>

<i> <b> Describe skills, qualifications and experience required for the position </b> </i> <br> <br>

The position is highly advanced and would require a tenured applicant with over 8 years of experience in the application support industry and managing IT programs alongside years of experience of being a team leader . Furthermore, your portfolio would need to demonstrate experience working in intense environments whilst being to keep a positive attitude to motivate a team. Experience in cloud computing concept and services such as SaaS (Software as a service) is an absolute must as the company specialises in Facility Maintenance, you will need to ensure software is always up to date communicating with other devices.

</p>

<p>

<i> <b> What skills do I currently have? </b> </i> <br> <br>

Through my current full time job, I have 2 years experience in managing a team and , 1 on 1s with agents and creating action plans. I currently do basic IT in my current role which includes setting up desks for my team members and connecting the wiring. I also have experience in SaaS software as it’s one of the main work order management systems we are to use. I’m highly proficient in the business aspect of things such as project management and team leading but have a lot to improve on when it comes to IT and software management.

</p>

<p>
<i> <b> How will I obtain the skills & qualifications for the ideal job? </b> </i> <br> <br>



I have built experience through my current job team leading. Further experience is needed without a doubt, this involves completing my IT degree through schooling. Getting a junior level software analyst job as a start and progressing through other IT roles relevant. Partnering that degree & roles from the IT role alongside the current team leading experience that I currently have, I will be a strong applicant.

<i> <b> <u> Personality Test Results </u> </b> </i> <br> <br>

<br> <br>

<i> <b> What do these results mean for me? </b> </i> <br> <br>


I completed the Big Five, Myers-Briggs and the learning styles tests. All of the results were pretty accurate for the most part for how I am as a person. <BR> <BR>

The results from the Big Five and Myers-Briggs show that I’m highly extroverted and that I don’t mind meeting people or striking conversations with strangers. The Learning Styles tests indicate that I am more suited towards a Pragmatist style which means that I like to learn through practical methods and case studies. 

</P>

<p>

<i> <b> How will these results influence my behaviour in a team? </b> </i> <br> <br>

In a team I’m generally the one throwing the ideas and the what if scenarios out there. I can picture the worst and best case of a scenario and use that to my advantage. I currently work as a team leader and have daily discussions with my team on how we can effectively maximise our efficiency together when completing work documents. I often assign roles and have a comfortable time dealing with existing and new team members.

</p>

<P>

<i> <b> How should I take this into account when forming a team?  </b> </i> <br> <br>

Taking into account the results provided in the test, I believe that having a team mixed with introverted personalities with a theorist learning style would work alongside an extroverted person like myself. I would be sparking up conversations, and once that starts happening it’s similar to a snowball effect where everyone starts pitching in.

<i> <b> <u> Project Idea </u> </b> </i> <br> <br>


<i> <b> Overview </b> </i> <br> <br>

My project idea is an application that can be used to authenticate game & trading cards such as Yu-Gi-OH, Pokemon, Baseball and more to ensure that they are real. At a very basic level, a camera with a database of particular trading card branded images of authentic and fake cards used to distinguish the fake would be the goal, ultimately this could expand to whole machinery that can use this system. <br>

This application can be pitched to reselling companies such as Troll and Toad & Mighty Collectibles to make it as seamless as possible when verifying trading cards. I would like this application to be used commercially first but later to be rolled out to the wider consumer base after a certain period. 

</P>

<p>

<i> <b> Motivation </b> </i> <br> <br>

A recent article written in 2022 by the Nintendo Wire has advised that over 43 billion cards have been sold by Pokemon in March 22 alone (1). The line is blurred when it comes to what’s real and fake, utlising a simple phone camera to scan the front & back of a card to determine its authenticity would be an absolute game changer for this problem. This not only lies with Pokemon cards but for baseball cards and Yu-Gi-Oh and much more. The market is so large and there are many different opportunities for companies to work without even discussing the consumer space at the moment. 

</p>

<p>
<i> <b> Description </b> </i> <br> <br>

Inspired by the market and made for the consumer, this is how I would like to describe my product.     Not only are we able to penetrate such a huge market space but it’d be ever expanding for any other product that we’re able to set our eyes on, with so many different companies that create(d) trading cards, the sky's the limit with how this app can be utlised. <br> <br>

The app in its final version would have different options for the type of company that it’s for, EG. Pokemon, Magic the Gathering etc. We’d implement an ever growing database  of images that can sort for discrepancies between certain cards and be able to give a stamp/verification seal which would allow reselling to be easier. Imagine StockX with shoes but for cards - We’d simplify the process process to allow for growth in the community.

</p>


<p>

<i> <b> Tools and Technologies </b> </i> <br> <br>

Some tools required at a very basic level would be:
<ul>
<li>A computer to write the software and access the storage/database</li>
<li>A phone with a high quality camera to test out the application</li>
<li>A storage system that will hold the database of fake/real trading card images that allows for distinguishing of discrepancies with the cards</li>
<li>A virtual machine/raspberry PI as a second system for troubleshooting</li>
</ul>

</p>


<p>

<i> <b> Skills Required </b> </i> <br> <br>

The skills required to complete this project would be

<ul>
<li>CSS Knowledge to create a phone application</li>
<li>Code writing software such as Adobe Dreamweaver which will give you access to Java, HTML, CSS & more for the software to start being written.</li>
<li>Possible AI integration for the app to get smarter/learn over time.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>

<i> <b> Desired Outcome </b> </i> <br> <br>

If the project is successful, the best positive outcome is that the consumers should be able to use their mobile phones to start authenticating their trading cards. This would be such a huge win as they would be able to differentiate fake and real cards at ease, eliminating most of the fake resellers in the market from the equation.<br> 
Ultimately I want the app to be able to have multiple different company branded cards and an easy to User Interface that allows the individual to search through ease.
